description: Optimize code for performance
---

Analyze the current code and optimize it for better performance:

1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Reduce time complexity where possible
3. Minimize memory usage
4. Remove redundant operations
5. Cache expensive computations
6. Use more efficient data structures if applicable

Provide before/after comparisons and explain the performance improvements.
