---

Generate comprehensive tests for the current code:

1. Create unit tests for all functions
2. Add edge case testing
3. Include error handling tests
4. Add integration tests if applicable
5. Ensure good test coverage
6. Use the project's existing test framework

If no test file exists, create one following the project's conventions.
